Version: 0.0.9 (BETA)

Introducing a character-to-character relationship system. As your bond with other players strengthens, so does your ability to fight with them, work with them, etc. 

## Advancing through the system

The system is defined by relationship levels, which are listed in the next section.

Most of you will start at acquaintance level with another character. Reaching a new relationship level with another char has a chance to develop into better ways of working together. Once you reach a new relationship level  with someone, work together with them and the dungeon master in order to develop a unique boon for your characters. This could be something like being able to communicate without words, helping each other regardless of proficiency requirements, or adding small bonuses to certain combat actions relevant to your classes. 

Depending on the chosen boon, I will assign a difficulty die, either a dice of d20, d12, d10, d8, d6 or d4. For example, learning to communicate complex messages non-verbally (sign language) could have a difficulty of d8, while learning to work together in combat to grant bonuses to attack rolls might start you with d20 instead.

Then, you need to spend 2 hours every day working on learning whatever it is you want to do together. At the end of 2 hours, do a Boon Check. Roll your current dice and, on a maximum roll, you make a Boon Success. A Boon Success means that next time you work on your boon together you roll the next smaller die instead. Once you reach a d4, you must accumulate 3 Boon Successes by rolling a 4. Once you do so, your boon is fully realized and available for you to use.

You may spend up to 4 hours working together per day, and that means that you get a Boon Success on a max roll or 1 below. So, on a dice of d12, you'd get a Boon Success on an 11 or a 12. Additionally, character interactions, whether in role playing or combat or similar, might grant you a bonus of +1 to ONE Boon Check. On a d4, no bonuses will help you. 

Note: your availability of boons increases with your relationship level (you won't have access to d20 boons right away) and your relationship levels increase in many ways, from roleplaying interactions to working together in battles. 


## Boon Examples

  - (Combat Boon, d20) Whenever you both are facing an enemy that you both can reach with your weapon in melee range, and you are not currently flanking, you may add +1 to your attack roll against that target. 
  - (Combat Boon, d10) Once per short rest, and when standing next to each other, if an enemy makes makes an attack against either one of you, the non-attacked player can use their reaction to provide the attacked player with a bonus of +1 to AC for that one attack. 
  - (Ability Boon, d8) You have advantage on insight checks on non-verbal communications between each other (sign language)
  - (Ability Boon, d6) You can help your ally with an ability check for which you have no proficiency, giving the roll a +1 bonus
  

## Relationship Levels

Here are the currently available relationship levels. 

### Relationship Levels

#### Friendship

 - The mentor can teach the other player a skill they are proficient with, under some conditions. See "Learning New Proficiencies" below
 - Close Friendship's Boons

Requirements: Close Friendship or Higher

## Learning New Proficiencies

In order to learn a new skill, tool or weapon, you must train at least 4 hours a day with your mentor. After this time training, you can attempt a Training check in order to incerease your understanding. 

### Limited by intelligence

You may only learn a number of proficiencies equal to double your intelligence modifier (minimum 1)

### Training a proficiency

Pick something you want to learn - a tool, weapon, language or skill - and then determine the appropriate ability for that proficiency. 

```markdown
| New Proficiency | Ability Required                     |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Language        | Intelligence                         |
| Skill           | Varies                               |
| Tool            | Varies                               |
| Weapon          | Strength or Dexterity (if finesse)   |
```


Once you have selected what you wish to train, and have chosen the proper ability score, you can then spend four hours and at the end of practice, you can then roll a d20. This is your Training Check and if you roll the maximum amount, you have successfully made progress on training your new proficiency. You can now roll a d12 instead of a d20 when you make your next Training Check.

The Training Check die continues to decrease in size on every result of a maximum amount. This means that your Training Check die will begin as a d20, and then slowly get smaller as you increase your own understanding and make progress on your training. It goes from a d20 to a d12, d10, d8, d6, and last a d4.

Once you roll a 4 on a d4, you mark a Training Success and you must gain a number of Training Successes equal 4. Once you gain a number of required Training Successes, you are considered proficient.

You can only make a Training Check once per day. If you practice for an additional 4 hours a day, for a total of 8 hours, on a result of a 19 or 20 on the die, you can make progress and move on to the next die. Spending additional time training has no additional effect on a d4.

#### Relevant Abilities

Your relevant ability modifier allows you to automatically succeed and make progress on your Training Check a number of times equal to the ability modifier, up to a maximum of five times. This means that your die size automatically decreases a number of times equal to your modifier. See the chart below.

|Ability Modifier|Your Starting Die Size|
|---|---|
|+0|d20|
|+1|d12|
|+2|d10|
|+3|d8|
|+4|d6|
|+5|d4|

If you are a 2nd level Cleric with a +3 bonus to Wisdom and you wish to learn the Medicine skill, you would start out with a d8 for your Training Check. At the end of 4 hours where you practiced and studied medicine, anatomy, and health - you would then roll a d8. On a roll of 8, you would then move on to a d6 for the check. You would repeat this Training Check until you gained 2 successes on a d4 die.

#### Training Costs

Certain proficiencies will require a cost in gold to pay for supplies and materials. On average, the cost is 2gp per day, but it may be lower or higher depending of what is being trained.
